          <h1>Succulents</h1>
          <p>
            In botany, <b>succulent plants</b>, also known as <b>succulents</b>,
            are plants with parts that are thickened, fleshy, and engorged,
            usually to retain water in arid climates or soil conditions. The
            word <i>succulent</i> comes from the Latin word <i>sucus</i>,
            meaning 'juice', or 'sap'. Succulent plants may store water in
            various structures, such as leaves and stems. Succulents are often
            grown as ornamental plants because of their striking and unusual
            appearance, as well as their ability to thrive with relatively
            minimal care.

          <h1>How to Care for Succulents</h1>
          <p>
            Whether you’ve been gifted a jade plant or you picked up a echeveria
            at the store, it’s important to learn how to care for succulents.
            Read on to find out how to keep your plants healthy and happy.
          </p>
          <h2>Make Sure Your Succulents Get Enough Light</h2>
          <p>
            Succulents love light and need about six hours of sun per day,
            depending on the type of succulent. Newly planted succulents can
            scorch in direct sunlight, so you may need to gradually introduce
            them to full sun exposure or provide shade with a sheer curtain.
          </p>
          <h2>Rotate Succulents Frequently</h2>
          <p>
            Succulents love direct sun, but if yours is sitting in the same
            exact spot day after day, it's likely that only one side is getting
            enough light.
          </p>
          <h2>Water According to the Season</h2>
          <p>
            Just like us, succulents need more energy when they're in a period
            of growth. During the spring and summer, the plants are thriving and
            drinking up much more water than when they're resting in the fall
            and winter.
          </p>
          <h2>Fertilize Succulents in the Summer</h2>
          <p>
            Succulents don’t need much fertilizer, but you can give them light
            feedings during the spring and summer growing season. Be careful not
            to overfertilize—this can cause your succulent to grow too quickly
            and become weak.
          </p>

        <div id="facts">
          <h1>Interesting Facts</h1>
          <h2>Over 60 Succulent Families</h2>
          <p>
            You may think of succulents as a single family, but the truth is
            that there are more than 60 different families of succulents. In
            fact, there are approximately 10,000 plant varieties that you can
            grow.
          </p>
          <h2>Quite a Bit of Color and Variety</h2>
          <p>
            Succulents grow in a variety of colors and textures. Of course,
            shades of green are going to be the most common, but these plants
            can also have shades of pink, blue, purple, yellow, red, and orange
            in the leaves and the blooms.
          </p>
          <h2>Succulents are Easy to Grow</h2>
          <p>
            You can propagate succulents from cuttings or pieces of the stem
            that break away from the main plant. It does not require a lot of
            effort on your part to start the new plant, simply place the cutting
            by a window, and soon new sprouts will begin to grow on the end of
            the cutting. Once the roots begin to form, you can place the small
            plant in soil and give it a bit of water.
          </p>
          <h2>Pest Resistant Plants</h2>
          <p>
            Most succulents do not have a lot of issues with pests. You may find
            aphids on some outside plants, but they are uncommon, which makes
            succulents some of the easiest plants to care for. The insects that
            you see around the plants are typically only on specific varieties
            because succulents such as stapeliads are great for pollination.
          </p>
          <h2>Succulents can be Fashionable</h2>
          <p>
            Succulents are plants that are small enough to grow on jewelry.
            Since they are low maintenance, you can place the plants on
            bracelets, earrings, and even rings and wear them for a few weeks at
            a time. You can even make a boutonniere or a corsage with small
            enough succulents.
